# IK Config
In our ik config such as `smplx_to_g1.json` or `smplx_to_dash.json`, you might find following params. I add annotations here for your understanding.

## DASH Robot Configuration

The DASH robot uses an **optimized motion-based configuration** that provides superior motion retargeting quality:

- **Motion-based scaling**: Scale factors derived from actual human motion analysis
- **Optimized weights**: Feet (100/40), Torso (100/25), Joints (0/20)
- **Proper joint alignment**: Corrected rotation offsets for each robot joint
- **Dual IK tables**: Primary for stability, secondary for fine-tuning

### Key Configuration Files
- `general_motion_retargeting/ik_configs/smplx_to_dash.json` - Active motion-optimized configuration
- `general_motion_retargeting/ik_configs/bvh_lafan1_to_dash.json` - BVH motion support
- `general_motion_retargeting/ik_configs/smplx_to_dash.json.backup` - Original configuration backup
- `configs/dash/smplx_to_dash_optimized.json` - Motion-optimized configuration (recommended)
- `configs/dash/smplx_to_dash_corrected.json` - Basic corrected configuration
